    - synced DBIx::Class with DB schema


0.64    2007-04-23
    - moved svn repo to http://code.google.com/p/cpants/
    - added DBD::Pg to depencies, reported by MSTEVENS as RT #26377
    - first create a dist object, add the data later in another eval. This

    - added t/99_pod.t test (I'm not in the mood right now to write docs
      so t/99_pod_coverage.t has to wait a bit...)
    - adapted DBIx::Class calls to 0.07000
    - delete dist from DB if they are no longer on CPAN
      thanks to BDFOY and TINITA for pointing it out.
